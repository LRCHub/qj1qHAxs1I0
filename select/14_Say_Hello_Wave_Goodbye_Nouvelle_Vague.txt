Standing in the door of the pink flamingo
Crying in the rain
It was a kind of so so love
And I'm going to make sure it never happens again

You and I had to be
The standing joke of the year
You were asleep around
A lost and found and not for me, I fear

I tried to make it work, you in a cocktail skirt
And me in a suit, well, it just wasn't me
You're used to wearing less
And now your life's a mess, so insecure, you see

Put up with all the scenes and this is one scene
That's going to be played my way

Take your hands off me
I don't belong to you, you see
Take a look at my face for the last time
I never knew you, you never knew me
Say hello goodbye

Under the deep red light
I can see the makeup sliding down
Hey, little girl, you will always make up
So take off that unbecoming frown

What about me, well, I'll find someone
That's not going cheap in the sales
A nice little housewife who'll give me a steady life
And won't keep going off the rails

Take your hands off me
I don't belong to you, you see
Take a look at my face for the last time
And I never knew you, you never knew me
Say hello goodbye

We've been involved for quite a while now
And to keep you secret has been hell
We're strangers meeting for the first time, okay
Just smile and say hello, say hello, then wave goodbye

Take your hands off me
I don't belong to you, you see
Take a look at my face for the last time
I never knew you, you never knew me
Say hello goodbye

Then wave goodbye
Wave goodbye, goodbye
Say hello, then wave goodbye
Say, say hello
Say hello, then wave goodbye
