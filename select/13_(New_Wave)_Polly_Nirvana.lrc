[00:05.59] Polly wants a cracker
[00:08.03] I think I should get off of her first
[00:10.42] Maybe she wants some water
[00:12.97] To put out the blow torch
[00:25.47] 
[00:15.32] It isn't me
[00:16.53] We have some seed
[00:17.84] Let me clip
[00:19.13] Your dirty wings
[00:20.40] Let me take a ride
[00:21.69] Don't hurt yourself
[00:22.89] I want some help
[00:24.06] To please myself
[00:32.06] 
[00:25.36] I've got some rope
[00:26.53] You have been told
[00:27.74] I promise you
[00:29.04] I have been true
[00:30.22] Let me take a ride
[00:31.47] Don't hurt yourself
[00:32.78] I want some help
[00:33.80] To help myself
[00:40.80] 
[00:40.04] Polly wants a cracker
[00:42.50] Maybe she would like more food
[00:44.97] She asks me to untie her
[00:47.36] A chase would be nice for a few
[01:02.86] 
[00:49.87] It isn't me
[00:51.07] We have some seed
[00:52.23] Let me clip
[00:53.40] Your dirty wings
[00:54.73] Let me take a ride
[00:55.90] Don't hurt yourself
[00:57.22] I want some help
[00:58.43] To please myself
[01:06.43] 
[00:59.64] I've got some rope
[01:00.94] You have been told
[01:02.11] I promise you
[01:03.36] I have been true
[01:04.58] Let me take a ride
[01:05.86] Don't hurt yourself
[01:07.19] I want some help
[01:08.37] To help myself
[01:15.37] 
[01:11.65] Polly says
[01:14.68] Polly says her back hurts
[01:17.04] And she's just as bored as me
[01:19.33] She caught me off my guard
[01:21.92] It amazes me, the will of instinct
[01:38.92] 
[01:24.38] It isn't me
[01:25.67] We have some seed
[01:26.84] Let me clip
[01:28.06] Your dirty wings
[01:29.35] Let me take a ride
[01:30.64] Don't hurt yourself
[01:31.80] I want some help
[01:33.16] To please myself
[01:41.16] 
[01:34.31] I've got some rope
[01:35.57] You have been told
[01:36.63] I promise you
[01:37.88] I have been true
[01:39.21] Let me take a ride
[01:40.54] Don't hurt yourself
[01:41.82] I want some help
[01:43.11] To help myself
