Polly wants a cracker
Think I should get off her first
Think she wants some water
To put out the blow torch
Isn't me
Have a seed
Let me clip
Your dirty wings
Let me take a ride
Cut yourself
Want some help
Please myself
Got some rope
Have been told
Promise you
Have been true
Let me take a ride
Cut yourself
Want some help
Please myself
Polly wants a cracker
Maybe she would like some food
She asks me to untie her
Chase would be nice for a few
Isn't me
Have a seed
Let me clip
Your dirty wings
Let me take a ride
Cut yourself
Want some help
Please myself
Got some rope
Have been told
Promise you
Have been true
Let me take a ride
Cut yourself
Want some help
Please myself
Polly said
Polly says her back hurts
She's just as bored as me
She caught me off my guard
Amazes me the will of instinct
Isn't me
Have a seed
Let me clip
Your dirty wings
Let me take a ride
Cut yourself
Want some help
Please myself
Got some rope
Have been told
Promise you
Have been true
Let me take a ride
Cut yourself
Want some help
Please myself
